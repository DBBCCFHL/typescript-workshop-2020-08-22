# Exercise: Create your first types - 10min

1. In `App.tsx`, define a function called `getUserName` that takes **one** argument, `user`.

2. `user` is an object with two properties; `firstName` and `lastName`. They are both strings:

```ts
const user = {
  firstName: 'Braedon',
  lastName: 'Gough',
}
```

3. This function should return one string which is a concatenation of the two properties of `user`

4. Use this function and display the string somewhere in the component.
